        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I'm Anu from Thrissur. I'm a Graduated Student. I've completed my degree in BCA from Calicut University in this year. I'm from a middle class family which consists of 4 members.To describe about me in a short way is.. I am ambitious and driven.
            I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself.and I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.In my free times i do some random art works.I found I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn't say in any other way for things I had no words for. So yes Art is my passion.My goal is to have a well maintained job in a Better Company. So That's why i choose this coding.
            Thank you..</p>
